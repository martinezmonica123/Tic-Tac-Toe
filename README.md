# Tic-Tac-Toe

##	1. Overview: 
	     This TicTacToe implementation keeps a record of all the moves made by both 
      computer and the human players. By doing so the computer is able to block winning moves 
        and make its own winning moves whenever possible. When not possible moves are made based on
        slots more likely to generate winning sequences. (Mainly center, corner, then edge locations.)
##  2. Specifications: 
        This program should:
		  - allow for a human player
		  - play against a computer player

		  - never lose and win whenever possible
##	3. Design: 
        The program is separated into 3 different classes: Player, Board, and TicTacToe; Text-based UI.
##	4. To run:
